Built a high-accuracy energy consumption forecasting model, reducing RMSE to 0.3339 through Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Conducted EDA to analyze energy load trends, weather impact, and renewable energy contributions for better forecasting.
Deployed the model using Gradio, enabling an interactive web-based tool for real-time predictions.
